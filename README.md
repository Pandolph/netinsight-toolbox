netinsight-toolbox
==================
Background

The brain is the most complex object in the universe, which is mainly constitute by neuronal and vascular network. However, we still knows little about the detailed neuronal connections and vascular architecture, and the systematic reconstruction and analyses still remains a great challenge. One of the main obstacles is the lack of effective image analysis software to help us to get insight of the underlying principle of brain organization and function.

Aims and scope

The aim of NetInsight toolbox (NIO) is helping us to understand the underlying detailed neuronal connections and vascular architecture in the brain. It is a general tool for automatic tracing and quantitative analysis of the network structures. We hope that this toolbox would become an effective software in the connectomic studies.

Name meaning

Just as the name implies, NetInsight toolbox means getting insight of a complex network and it is developed as a matlab toolbox. Besides, the name of NIO is inspired by the fictional character Neo in the well-known film Matrix, and the pronunciation is same with the leading role Neo. It is implied that we must fight together to understand the deep nature of our world.
